This project focuses on developing advanced skills in CSS and JavaScript to build interactive and responsive websites.

Key Objectives:

Responsive Design with Media Queries:
Implement media queries to ensure layouts, typography, and components adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Interactive JavaScript Projects:
Build engaging features such as an interactive quiz with multiple questions and an image carousel that rotates images based on user interaction (e.g., button clicks or automatic transitions).

Fetching Data from APIs:
Learn to connect with external APIs by fetching and displaying real-time data dynamically on the webpage, such as weather information or jokes from a public API.
